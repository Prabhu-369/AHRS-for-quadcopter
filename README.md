# AHRS-for-quadcopter
• Attitude Estimation based on Extended Kalman Filtering method. 
• Gyro bias estimation to improve the robustness of the algorithm. 
• Attitude prediction to be done using gyro output. 
• Attitude is updated using accelerometer and magnetometer output.

Please refer the attached pdf in this section for math equations and c++ code for AHRS code
